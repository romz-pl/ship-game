# Simple ship game

1. The implematation is in C++ and it is based on the source code provided in the [Sanjay Madhav's book "Game Programming in C++"](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Creating-Games-Design/dp/0134597206), chapter 2. The original code is available in [repository](https://github.com/gameprogcpp/code).

1. The prerequite for building is installed [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/) and SDL2_image library. 

1. The project uses [cmake](https://cmake.org/) configuration files, and hence is platform independent.

1. In order to build the project make the following steps:
    - clon this git repository into `ship` directory;
    - create build directory outside the cloned source directory;
    - type: `cd build && cmake ../ship && make`
    - in order to start the game use `build/src/ship` binary file.
